# SPARC

**S**mart **P**otential with **A**tomistic **R**are Events and **C**ontinuous Learning

## Overview

SPARC is an open-source Python package that implements an active learning workflow for developing reactive machine learning potentials. It automates the process of running _ab-initio_ calculations, training ML models, and identifying new structures that need quantum mechanical labeling.

## Key Features

- Ab initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD) using [VASP](https://www.vasp.at/)
- Machine learning potential training with [DeepMD-kit](https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit)
- Deep Potential Molecular Dynamics (DPMD) simulations
- Active learning for continuous model improvement
- Reactive trajectory generation with [PLUMED](https://www.plumed.org/) integration

## Requirements

### Core Dependencies
- Python 3.xx
- [DeepMD-kit](https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit) 2.2.10
- [ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) (Atomic Simulation Environment)
- [VASP](https://www.vasp.at/) (for DFT calculations)
- [PLUMED](https://www.plumed.org/) (for enhanced sampling)
- MPI library

### Python Package Dependencies
- numpy
- pandas
- dpdata

## Installation

1. Create and activate a conda environment:
```bash
conda create -n sparc python=3.10
conda activate sparc
```

2. Install PLUMED:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge py-plumed
```

4. Clone and install SPARC:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rahulumrao/sparc.git
cd sparc
pip install .
```

## Quick Start

1. Set up VASP POTCAR files path:
```bash
export VASP_PP_PATH=/path/to/vasp/potcar_files
```

2. Create an input file (see example below)

### Example Input File
```yaml
general:
  structure_file: "POSCAR"
  md_steps: 1000
  log_frequency: 10

md_simulation:
  thermostat: "Nose"
  temperature: 300.0
  timestep_fs: 1.0

dft_calculator:
  name: "VASP"
  exe_path: "/path/to/vasp"
  exe_name: "vasp_std"
```

See `scripts/input.yaml` for a complete configuration template.


## Core Components

### 1. MD Simulation
- Supports both _ab initio_ and DeepPotential Molecular Dynamics wihtin ASE
- NVT ensemble with Nose-Hoover thermostat
- Checkpoint/restart capabilities
- Optional PLUMED integration for enhanced sampling

### 2. DeepMD Training
- Automated model training
- Multiple model generation for labelling
- Configurable network architecture and training parameters

### 3. Active Learning
- Query by Committee approach for structure selection
- Force-based deviation metrics
- Automated structure labeling and retraining

## Workflow

1. **Initial AIMD**
   - Runs ab initio MD using VASP
   - Generates training data

2. **DeepMD Training**
   - Processes AIMD trajectories
   - Trains multiple DeepMD models
   - Freezes and compresses models

3. **DPMD Simulation**
   - Runs MD using trained DeepPotential models
   - Monitors force deviations

4. **Active Learning**
   - Identifies structures for labeling
   - Performs DFT calculations on selected structures
   - Retrains models with expanded dataset

## Current Status

- ✅ Active learning with candidate labeling implemented
- 🚧 Code refinement in progress
- 🚧 Support for additional DFT calculators planned
- 📝 Documentation under development

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> There are some version dependencies, currently the latest version of `deepmd-kit` is not supported. Check [documentation](https://deepmd-kit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/easy-install.html) for installation of older version.

## Limitations

- Currently only supports DeepMD-kit 2.2.10 (newer versions not yet supported)
- Limited to VASP for DFT calculations
- Documentation is still being developed
